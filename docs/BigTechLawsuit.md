J. This Court has jurisdiction over the questions of law at hand and this is the most suitable Court to hear this question of Federal Law.

#### A. BIG TECH consists of a network of platforms that are not governed under 47 US Code Section 230.

#### A. BIG TECH is a Silicone Valley Monopoly.

Big Tech is a monopoly in Silicone Valley California. About 86% of Silicone Valley votes for Democrats. Big Tech founders, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, and  all know each other. Big Tech works as one to maintain their monopoly. The relationships of the higher ups in BIG TECH have metaphorically incestuous relationships. The come up in Silicone Valley you have to do so through the circles under control of BIG TECH and their investors.

#### B. BIG TECH is too large to moderate and presence of children constitute a Corporate Town.

BIG TECH has been performing wide-scale psychological manipulation of the American public using advanced AI algorithms along with paid human predicted class classification to change the behavior of people to make their speech more advertiser friendly in the most number of countries as possible. A long time ago there used to be corporations that owned entire towns called Corporate towns. These towns are governed under the US Constitution[1]. Big Tech has attained a monopoly that is akin to a corporate town, almost everyone in the US is on Big Tech, including children who watch YouTube regularly. Many people's entire lives are wrapped up into their online persona, which is their brand. The sheer volume of content that requires moderation on BIG TECH platforms, requiring armies of paid moderators who can get PTSD from looking at obscenities like animal cruelty. There is obviously a need to keep this obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected away from where it can cause harm. The problem is when if you want to entire the market, that you require massive investment to fund moderators with hyper sophisticated AI technologies and if you dont' have this technology they'll shut you down like they did Parler.

The children of INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY also are very active on BIG TECH PLATFORMS, even if they are under age 13 children often use their parent's YouTube account. The children of some of INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY spend hours per day watching YouTube videos, which is more time than they spend engaging in school. INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY also publicly performs independent news and political commentary for the general public when users with BIG TECH accounts display the content to users who do not have BIG TECH accounts and did not consent to their terms of service.

Foreign companies and State actors for governments such as China and Russia are able to utilize AI algorithms to manipulate the behavior of children through BIG TECH platforms.

#### C. BIG TECH unlawful censored alleged COVID and Medical misinformation.

No where in 47 US Code Section 230 does it give any protection for companies screening misinformation. YouTube censored multiple INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY videos for use of the CDC chart entitled `U.S. Deaths from Coronavirus by Age Group (Feb. 1 - June 17, 2020).  Some of the COVID misinformation on YouTube that gets censored is legitimately misinformation, but news presenters and commenters aren't given the ability to fact check their own content. YouTube has access to advanced AI algorithms to detect misinformation faster than content creators can detect and thus are unable to self fact check due to Google's AI dominance. RSS Commentary had some videos taken down for what at the time was the most accurate information there was at the time on on the projected deaths of COVID-19 in the following chart. When RSS Commentary did become aware the videos contained misinformation Cale McCollough took down the videos that contained the known misinformation. However, it is not possible on YouTube to just clip out a section and insert a fixed section without resetting your like count, which can be devastating to a video's view count. No option was given to trim out the misinformation out of the video.

At some point this year the CDC updated the death tolls and there was dramatically more deaths than projected. The CDC has overhauled their website located at 

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/mortality-overview.htm

entitled "COVID-19 Mortality Overview", the total number of COVID deaths has been through the week ending 5/29/2021, 583,025 deaths, and approximately 647,312 excess deaths, which is a mid point between 580,751 to 713,873 deaths. Subtracting the maximum number of excess deaths, and there are up to 130,848 excess deaths beyond the reported COVID deaths. Many of these deaths are due to lockdowns and mask mandates causing explosions of disease as will explained in a later argument section. At the time of the publishing of the above chart that does after the fact include misinformation we didn't know how many people would die, but it was known that overreacting to COVID might cause excess deaths, and by averaging out the deaths for multiple years the number of deaths may still average out to approximately the same number of deaths as was expected before COVID-19 broke out.

#### D. BIG TECH unlawful censored news, commentary, and critique of ballot harvesting and related election fraud.

Ballot harvesting is the act of private individuals collecting mail-in ballots. Ballot harvesting is voter fraud for the following reason

1. Computer vision scanner apps for mobile devices allow ballot harvesters to detect the party of the voter by taking a picture of the ballot signature and matching it to their voter registration data and to throw out Trump votes.
2. Most Democrats live in big cities that are vastly more dense populations than small-to-medium sized cities and rural areas. 
3. Most Republicans live in small to medium sized cities with significantly lower population density than Democrat strongholds.
4. Mail-in Voting and ballot harvesting dramatically biases elections towards Democrats because most Democrats live in big cities where the density of people is dramatically higher, and Democrats cal rig the election by paying ballot harvesters to harvest private votes, Democrats will always win due to how many extra miles are needed to traverse to collect the ballots in rural areas where most Republicans live.

Big Tech has engaged in coordinated censorship of Election fraud information, including Ballot harvesting as a method of fraud. YouTube censored the RSS Commentary video entitled "Facebook BANS 'Stop the Steal' political movement, hashtags". In this video Cale McCollough called ballot harvesting election fraud, causing the video to get flagged for Election Misinformation and taken down.

#### E. BIG TECH works on behalf of Democrat Politicians.

On October 19, 2020 California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat preceded by Kamala Harris, sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, and Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube urging Big Tech to suppress content critical of mail-in voting, that Russians were perpetrating a disinformation campaign to stoke racial resentment, 'suppress' non-white votes, and sow distrust in our election system.

You can read the letter at: https://oag.ca.gov/sites/default/files/Election%20Interference%20Letter_10-19-2020.pdf

The letter reads 

> "The State of California Has  a Mandate to Protect its Citizens’ Voting Rights.
>California has a significant interest in protecting its citizens’ constitutional right to vote. State laws protect citizens by, for example, prohibiting interference with voting rights through violence, threats, intimidation, and other coercive conduct (see, e.g., Civ. Code, § 52.1(b); Elec.    Code, §§ 18502, 18540).  State laws also prohibit knowingly distributing intentionally misleading information about the time, place, manner of voting, and voter eligibility (see, e.g., Elec. Code, §§ 18302, 18543).  To further protect voters, state law requires social media companies that sell political advertisements to disclose who funded certain political advertisements and maintain an online record of such advertisements for public inspection (see, e.g., Gov.    Code, § 84504.6). 
> The California Department of Justice will not hesitate to enforce these laws against any individual or group that violates them.  However, given social media’s prominence and influence in American political discourse, you share a responsibility to use the tools at your disposal to combat the dissemination of disinformation that interferes with our electoral system and to report any illegal activity detected on your respective social media platforms that interferes with Americans’ right to vote. "

The use of the word However in the preceding sent is a direct threat to Big Tech that the District Attorney will use everything in his power, which includes filing antitrust action against Big Tech to break them up. The letter then uses the citation "Senate Report Vol. II, supra n.2 at p. 3", which is the Russiagate Report. Senator Kamala Harris sat on the Senate Select Committee for Intelligence behind the politically motivated Russia-gate witch hunt conspiracy theory that stoked hatred of Donald Trump and occupied our times with Big Media's constant gas lighting of Donald Trump. Big Media journalist piggy backed Trump's fame by constantly making up stories based on things Trump said that would #triggered people, meaning it gas lighted people. Currently former President Trump is on a 2-year suspension from Facebook but he publicly States he will be running in 2024.

On March 15, 2020 Mark Zuckerber sent an email to Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the President of the  U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In this email Zuckerberg starts referring to Fauci as Tony and says "As a central part of this hub, I think it would be useful to include a video from you because people trust and want to hear from our experts rather than just a bunch of agencies and political leaders.".

#### F. BIG TECH censors US Citizen's speech on the behalf of foreigners and hostile foreign governments like China.

BIG TECH doesn't censor speech because it's offensive, BIG TECH uses sophisticated AI algorithms that psychotically manipulate users to change their behavior to maximize the amount time spend on the platform. Facebook users are Facebook's number 1 products, and they receive approximately $7 profit per user per year. The primary source of BIG TECH's money is from advertising from corporations that are either foreign owned, owned by Chinese 'Communist'/Nazi Party officials, hereby referred to as CCP, or they are corporations who are expanding into the Chines market. China is not communist. Communist is a bottom-up rule by the community with a powerful central State that organizes the communist economic machine. Communism is based on Marxist dielectric materialism, which is where the proletariat (meaning workers) rises up and smashes the bourgeoisie (meaning land and business owning classes, typically white people). In communism private property is outlawed and violates face the death penalty or internment in gulags. This is in stark contrast to China, which has rampant capitalism. CCP members live in the lap of luxury while most Chinese live in poverty. China claims it has risen a large percent of it's population out of poverty, this is false, they change the definition of poverty to fudge their numbers like they always do. The CCP has all of China under surveillance, they have their own version of Wikipedia with official party propaganda. Chinese companies don't honor our antitrust laws. China has been engaging in widespread intellectual property theft the CIA refers to as Rob, Replicate, and Replace strategy that is part of the Made in China 2025 plan the CCP has to replace the US as world's #1 superpower and remove the US from global supply chains. CCP-controlled companies work together like a mafia with the Chinese and Russian military and intelligence agencies to cyber war and widespread IP theft to fortify Chinese and Russian companies and achieve complete market dominance over US companies using slave labor, including Uighur Muslim slave labor for the force-labor re-education concentration camps in Xinjiang China where they are committing genocide against the Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities. Unrestricted access to CCP controlled companies and their allies allows the Chinese 'Communist' Party to censor US speech and control our politics, which is absolutely illegal.

The reason BIG TECH is unlawfully censoring the speech of INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY is not the content of the speech being 'otherwise offensive', but rather the contrast between the raw real-talk of INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY is in stark contrast to the behavior BIG TECH is using their advanced AI algorithms to psychologically manipulate the American public to behave so the public will be cash cows who spend a maximum amount of time watching ads.

#### F. BIG TECH profited from enabling BLM riots and scam fundraisers on their platform.

America has seen the worst riots of it's history over the past year. After the January 6th US Capitol Siege both Google and Apple banned the social networking platform similar to Twitter named Parler form their app stores, and Amazon Web Services suspended their web hosting services without prior notice because of their involvement in the US Capitol Siege. If you create a fundraiser on Facebook you'll find there are a lot of Black Lives Matter charities you can donate to as can be seen in the below picture.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6005325/121228479-a913ab00-c841-11eb-9cd5-0c1587002c2d.png)

Black Lives Matter, hereby referred to as BLM, started out as a good idea based on bad data. The BLM narrative is that white supremacist cops are gunning down unarmed black men and this has caused black people to be murdered at double the rate of white people. This is a false narrative. Black Americans make up about 1/6 the US population but they account for over half of all murders committed, which is almost 20,000 per year. The number of people killed by far-right extremists in the US since the start of the KKK is only about 3,000 Black Americans murdered. For each unarmed black man killed by police there are over 1000 black men killed by black men. It's the elephant in the room. BIG TECH has been unlawfully censoring Americans independent news and political commentary but they never never stop the disinformation that is causing the riots. Facebook even directly profits by taking a small percent of the donations to BLM fundraisers.

More often than not, the money raised on BLM fundraisers doesn't go to where the fund raisers claim it will. The money BIG TECH has raised in BLM fundraisers has been used to fund riots, while BIG TECH censors all opposition to riots such as Right-wing militias from being able to use their Second Amendment Rights to serve America as a well regulated militia. A well regulated militia is akin to a police force during emergencies.

#### G. BIG TECH profits from and props up Big Media who gas light with false claims that prevents citizens from getting fair trials.

One of the most successful methods that journalist use get clicks is to gas light people. What this means is that you make them mad. RSS Commentary, one of the Plaintiffs, studied RSS feeds, RSS is a file format that most major news outlets use to publish their news digitally, and found a very high percent of the articles contained things that a politician said or did that made people angry. In the the Trump Presidency there was a pervasive problem of journalists piggy backing Trump's fame by publishing false claims about what Trump said and did to gaslight the crowd, which amped up the race riots of 2020.

In the Kenosha riots of 2020 Right-wing militia member Kyle Rittenhouse shot and killed two rioters and blow the arm off another. Rittenhouse was then politically prosecuted was forced to serve jail time for self defense. Officer Derek Chauvin, the one who restrained George Floyd leading to a heart attack, was also not able to receive a fair trial due to Big Media profiting on pushing a false narrative that cops are trying to kill unarmed black men. That kind of behavior is perfectly fine, but they

#### H. BIG TECH fortified Biden and suppressed Trump in the the 2020 Election.

In the Times Magazine article The Secret History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election, published  February 4, 2021 5:40 AM EST the authors allege that there was a 'Shadow Campaign' that operated without the General public knowledge using corporate resources that constitute illegal campaign contributions. “It was all very, very strange,” Trump said on Dec. 2. “Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint the winner, even while many key states were still being counted.” This article was published two days before the January 6 US Capitol Siege Democrats are labeling as an 'insurrection'. This article did contribute to the riot on January 6. In the Times Article it reads

>That’s why the participants want the secret history of the 2020 election told, even though it sounds like a paranoid fever dream–a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information. They were not rigging the election; they were fortifying it. And they believe the public needs to understand the system’s fragility in order to ensure that democracy in America endures.

The "Architect" of this plan was a gentleman named Mike Podhorzer, the senior advisor to the President of the AFL-CIO, which is extremely influential in the Democrat party.

#### I. BIG TECH caused tort-actionable injury to INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY that caused financial damages totaling $1.6 billion and the Court should order BIG TECH liable for damages.

BIG TECH has an unlawful monopoly that control the speech of a large percent of the US and the world. BIG TECH has unlawfully abused 47 US Code § 230 to unlawfully censor Republicans on the behalf of Democrat lawmakers related to Kamala Harris that was intended to fortify the election for Biden to suppress Trump on the false pretense that Russian disinformation was enough of a threat to the election to justify using a 'Shadow campaign' to stifle INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY to prevent our products from being commercially viable in order to prop up media outlets with deep ties in fascist China. BIG TECH's actions are a violation of the Sherman anti-trust act. BIG TECH's censorship of INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY was intended to censor US Citizens independent news and political commentary in the future that has not occurred yet.

#### J. This Court has jurisdiction over theses questions of law at hand and this is the most suitable Court to hear question of Federal Law.

The Questions of law that we are respectfully requesting the Court to decree an answer to answer are:

1. Does BIG TECH have a monopoly based on Silicone Valley.
2. Is BIG TECH a corporate town?
3. Has BIG TECH unlawfully censored INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY using 47 US Code § 230 on behalf of Democrats?
4. HAS BIG TECH caused damages to INDIE NEWS AND POLITICAL COMMENTARY and are they liable for the damages?
